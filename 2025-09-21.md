#### Real Options

I wonder if it's just because things I haven't looked into seem more promising than those I've started to look into. I'm increasingly interested in whether we could get good estimates of labor adjustment costs, and use those to explain the frozen labor market. We have investment, hiring, firing, etc., all grinding to a halt at the same time; this is _exactly_ what we'd expect from real options theory.

The risk here is that it's sort of well-trod territory. I'm sure David will have thoughts on Friday, but maybe the add here is identification? Having looked at the Haltiwanger / Davis / Bloom / etc., most of the measurement uses implied adjustment costs from models and the remaining measurement uses the VIX or other options-implied volatility. I guess there's this inherent challenge, which is that if we knew the distribution of uncertainty it would become risk. Still, I think this is worth pursuing. 

I know Larry seemed to say that Maarten and his paper was looking at firm discount rates and hiring. Maybe I'll take a look at that and see if there's overlap.

I think one thing that would be _very_ useful to start doing is the exercises from the [Dixit-Pyndick book](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sncv). These are super similar to the models [Erwan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R-tms2UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) taught us in corporate finance, but I could use the refresher. I really enjoyed them through quals, and realistically I'm going to have to teach a bunch of PhD students this stuff when I get into a job. It'll still be useful for me if I end up down a different path, these seem like super relevant technical tools to know and I'm always jealous of Nick's facility with them. He's naturally brilliant at this stuff, but I also know he just grinds problems like nobody's business and that's part of why he is so good. I can at least do the second thing; I have an hour a day at work I can spend on some continuous time stuff.

Besides, the things I'm interested in (different kinds of debt over the lifecycle, investment barriers, etc.) involve barrier strategies that become sets in discrete time but are points in continuous time. The continuous-time ML stuff also seems super useful for solving these models, and having an excuse to play around with them would be really fun.
#### Insurance 

I'm realizing that there's a phenomenal paper to write with the insurance data, and I should do it. It's true that it's a crowded field, but none of these people have census data. They can say that defaulting is more common as insurance rates rise, but they can't speak to the location choice afterwards. I'm sure the equilibrium stuff will be absolutely brutal, but it is so important that I think it's good to go ahead and try. 

Obviously it would be _nice_ to have the servicer level payments. Maybe I should email Mulder and Keys and just give them the paper idea; they might bring me along for the ride. Even if they don't, someone will have done the paper and we will learn something. No reason to hoard knowledge just because you can't write the paper. Still, I just don't think it's possible for me to do it without the loan level data...

I also need to start gathering data on _investment_. That means like building permit requests! I should see if that's available in California at the very least. For example maybe [this would work](https://www.publicrecords.com/california/legal-government-records/permits-inspections/). 

There also _must_ be something that I can do with that discontinuity. Maybe the logic for an instrument goes something like this:
1. An unconstrained firm _would have liked_ to raise interest rates >=7%, but chose not to. because of the barrier 
2. Instead, they price at 6.9%, which underprices the insurance for a specific year
3. The insurance company is still willing to post this price because shutting down / exit is costly and they can just raise prices again the next year.
4. If you have that insurance in that year, you will be experiencing some kind of underpricing that is exogenous to the unconstrained firms optimal pricing behavior (for some region)

This seems like basically a valid instrument under some conditions, I'm sure I can start to write them down. I think what I _would_ need is info on who your insurance provider is...that's not in McDash...but maybe I can use count level exposures over some period? Like prevalence of an insurer in a given period? We do see that each year in fire territory. Hmmm.......
