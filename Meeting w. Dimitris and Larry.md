	* recycle left behind / trade literature 
	* maybe political economy of innovation
	* "who gains and loses from an innovation subsidy"
		* for all innovation
		* for entrants 
* costs?
	* don't need to think about costs 
	* just ratio of the benefit between different groups of people 
	* just add up willingness to pay?
* WTP 
	* give them double the amount of innovation in a year, add up willingness to pay for this number in dollars
	* in the complete markets, people just consume aggregate output (w * l), add up willingness to pay in dollars for that output 
	* one version you subsidize everything one version you subsidize entry
