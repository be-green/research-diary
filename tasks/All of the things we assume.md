Ok here's an attempted list at what we assume

### Workers 
* There are two types of workers, $m$ and $l$
* Workers have $K$ job offers at a time
* Exogenous O-U process for human capital over time 
* If a firm $k$ in a worker's consideration set, the worker gets a new job offer $k'$ with match quality $z_{ik'}$ that replaces it, where $z_{ik'}$ is drawn from the stationary distribution
* Workers have GHH / CRRA preferences
* Workers consume wages  
* Workers maximize utility by frictionlessly choosing a job at each instant
* Works have an outside option that pays $R$, take home $R^{\beta_{\tau(i)}}$.
### Firms 
* Exogenous R&D cost function 
* Spending on innovation generates a probability of quality jump 
* Innovations drive quality jumps
* Monopolists due to entry threat + Bertrand competition 
* Production function, varieties aggregator, industry aggregator
* Innovation split into stealing vs. incremental stuff, probabilities exogenous
* New firms enter at an exogenous rate 
* Products have a chance of becoming obsolete, replaced with average quality
* Rate of new product line acquisition is proportional to current size 
### General
* Balanced Growth Path
* Aggregate growth rate 
* Risk free rate
* Business time / real time process
