This is a comparative static exercise

1. Keep firm size distribution the same 
2. We aren't comparing two equilibria, just the off path intensification of two types of innovation 
3. First, one that increases the total innovation rate
4. Second, one that increases the entry rate

I think I can do this all via the simulations, starting at the old stationary distribution, because we aren't transitioning to a new equilibrium.
