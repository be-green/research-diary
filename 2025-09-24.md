Here is an idea for converting a conformal inference interval into a hypothesis test of $\beta = 0$ in the scalar linear regression case. Our econometric model is 
$$y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$
and we want to know if $\text{cov}(x, y) \neq 0$. This corresponds to the estimate of beta, since in the scalar case we have 
$$\beta = \frac{\text{cov}(x, y)}{\text{var}(x)}$$
First, suppose that $\beta = 0$. Then
