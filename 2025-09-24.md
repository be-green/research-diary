Here is an idea for converting a conformal inference interval into a hypothesis test of $\beta = 0$ in the scalar linear regression case. Our econometric model is 
$$y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$
and we want to know if $\text{cov}(x, y) \neq 0$. This corresponds to the estimate of beta, since in the scalar case we have 
$$\beta = \frac{\text{cov}(x, y)}{\text{var}(x)}$$
First, suppose that $\beta = 0$. Then 
$$(y_i - \bar{y} - \beta x_i)^2 = (y_i  - \bar{y} )^2$$
and the mean squared error of our predictions does not improve under the linear model including $x$. Let $\hat{\beta}_{-i}$ be the OLS estimate leaving out observation $i$. Then we can estimate $MSE_{-i}$ as 

$$MSE_{-i}(\hat{\beta}) = \frac{1}{(N - 1)}\sum_{j \neq i}(y_j - \bar{y}_{-i} - \hat{\beta}_{-i}x_j)^2$$
while 
$$MSE_{-i}(\beta_0) = \frac{1}{(N - 1)}\sum_{j \neq i}(y_j - \bar{y}_{-i})^2$$
under the null hypothesis, $\beta_0 = 0$.
