Consider a just identified, scalar instrumental variables setting where we have 
$$y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon$$
where $E(x_i\epsilon_i) \neq 0$. We have a scalar instrument, $z$, such that 
$$E(z_i \epsilon_i) = 0$$
but we aren't sure if $z$ is strong. If $z$ is strong then 
$$\text{cov}(z_i, x_i) \neq 0$$

In other words, given the first-stage
$$x_i = \gamma z_i + u_i$$
we want to rule out that $\gamma = 0$.

Let us re-write this as a prediction problem. Let 
$$\hat{x}_i = \hat{\gamma} z_i$$be the predicted values of $x_i$ given $z_i$. The insight here is that predictive interval for $x_i$ given _no information_ must be the same as the predictive interval for $x_i$ given $z_i$ if $z_i$ is not informative about $x_i$. Let 
$$MSE(x, \hat{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2$$
and 
$$MSE(x, \bar{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$These two models should have the same mean square error asymptotically if $\gamma$ = 0.
