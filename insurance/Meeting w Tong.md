Existing Literature:
Sangmin Oh's paper
- cross-subsidization? 
- regulatory frictions matter 

Idea:
* analyze conduct in the insurance industry
* needing to persuade the regulator makes insurance backward-looking 
* may help explain cyclical hiking behavior (tacit collusion?)
	* per other papers this has been going on since ~1945, you can see it on the AM Best tapes
* different implications of regulatory frictions than the oh paper
	* catching up to profit maximizing prices 

Questions:
* large potential data collection effort, is this interesting enough to be worth it?
* is this something that's "already done"?
* to me seems like no...but curious for thoughts? 


Tong:
* not aware of papers that take this into account 
* cases 
	* increase based on prospective projections 
	* retrospective price increases 
* how are you going to pitch these things 
	* backward looking stuff 
		* interesting but not a finance paper
	* firms
		* related to corporate finance / liquidity / cash reserve 
		* insolvency cost for insurers 
	* identification is very cool 
	* welfare impacts coming from the price cap 
		* low hanging fruit 
	* if you think about the regulators, they share the same interest as the customers 
		* long-term contract between the firms and the regulators 
		* friction there is more like a moral hazard problem 
			* suppose I lie to the regulator 
			* optimal contracts given the moral hazard problem? 
				* pricing between insurers and providers 
				* sign on the firm, allow you a 5% increase relative to base price 
				* why would this occur? seems like it would be because of difficulty with verification 
* is there a secondary market for building permits ?
* jim poterba 
	* pricing frictions -- are they worth exploring
