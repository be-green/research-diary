Existing Literature:
Sangmin Oh's paper
- cross-subsidization? 
- regulatory frictions matter 

Idea:
* analyze conduct in the insurance industry
* needing to persuade the regulator makes insurance backward-looking 
* may help explain cyclical hiking behavior (tacit collusion?)
	* per other papers this has been going on since ~1945, you can see it on the AM Best tapes
* different implications of regulatory frictions than the oh paper
	* catching up to profit maximizing prices 

Questions:
* large potential data collection effort, is this interesting enough to be worth it?
* is this something that's "already done"?
* to me seems like no...but curious for thoughts? 


Tong:
* not aware of papers that take this into account 
* cases 
	* increase based on prospective projections 
	* retrospective price increases
