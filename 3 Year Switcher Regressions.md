Just change everything to 3 year from 5 year, should be straightforward.

* 1 vs 3 vs 5 made some different but not alot, we are still undershooting by around 1/2 at the 3 and 5 year switcher marks 

5 year:
worker_exit_coefs =

    0.0321   -0.0287
    0.0323   -0.0345
    0.0319   -0.0298
    0.0321   -0.0260
    0.0322   -0.0230
    0.0327   -0.0206

worker_badexit_coefs * 100

ans =

    0.3655   -0.1651
    0.1444   -0.0635
    0.3652   -0.1612
