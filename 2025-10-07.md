I think I need to summarize some of my thoughts going into meetings that I'm having with faculty later this week. There are a few strands of research I've been thinking about:

### Insurance
Larry keeps asking me about why we don't insure the value of land. I think that would be an interesting idea, but I'm not sure how it corresponds to something I can really ask about. 

Mulder and Keys seem to have data via S&P CoreLoan that would have the relevant insurance payments for my discontinuity idea. David has not heard this idea, would be good to bring it up even if McDash doesn't have it. This is the one that has to do with the timing of insurance payments to the homeowner post disaster, and the lock-in that follows.

In order to understand how mobility responds to changes in insurance prices, I also have a potential instrument: California has aggregated provider-level data at the zip level, which tells you the share of people using each company from fire-related insurance. California also has a discontinuity when it comes to raising rates on all insurance productsâ€“after you hit 7% there is an automatic hearing which makes almost all insurers loathe to do this. Tying this to the McDash data would let me instrument via some kind of shift share for insurance raises that are exogenously lower than the insurer would like them to be given unconstrained profit maximization.

I would really like to separate mobility and preferences over _risk_ from price signals from insurance. I'm not really sure how to do that, but I would be very interested in it. I was thinking that maybe the places where insurers are not able to raise ras
