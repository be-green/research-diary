I think I need to summarize some of my thoughts going into meetings that I'm having with faculty later this week. There are a few strands of research I've been thinking about.
### Insurance
Broad question: do we have the First Street model data anywhere? Does anyone here have access? They said they share with academics but I emailed them and have not heard.

Larry keeps asking me about why we don't insure the value of land. I think that would be an interesting idea, but I'm not sure how it corresponds to something I can really ask about. I think if anything it's just an interesting counterfactual in the disaster case.

Mulder and Keys seem to have data via S&P CoreLoan that would have the relevant insurance payments for my discontinuity idea. David has not heard this idea, would be good to bring it up even if McDash doesn't have it. This is the one that has to do with the timing of insurance payments to the homeowner post disaster, and the lock-in that follows.

In order to understand how mobility responds to changes in insurance prices, I also have a potential instrument: California has aggregated provider-level data at the zip level, which tells you the share of people using each company from fire-related insurance. California also has a discontinuity when it comes to raising rates on all insurance productsâ€“after you hit 7% there is an automatic hearing which makes almost all insurers loathe to do this. Tying this to the McDash data would let me instrument via some kind of shift share for insurance raises that are exogenously lower than the insurer would like them to be given unconstrained profit maximization.

I would really like to separate mobility and preferences over _risk_ from price signals from insurance. I'm not really sure how to do that, but I would be very interested in it. I was thinking that maybe the places where insurers are not able to raise rates as much as they'd like to would be some kind of exogenous variation in the price relative to risk signals, but observing the personalized pricing makes this quite difficult. Would love thoughts and feedback on this, or potential directions.

The real effects of insurance in terms of adaptation are all to do with new building. It seems like if we have permitting requests, as well as building characteristics, then we could see if insurance prices are actually having real effects in terms of climate change adaptation. I do have the locations of all historical building permits (or at least ~178 million), so that might be useful. I'm a little concerned that if I estimate a null it's going to be boring, though probably important for something like policy. Could potentially do a spatial merge w/ mcdash property characteristics? 

I'm also wondering about renter vs. owner share that follows from risk and insurance changes. I just got a dataset of posted rents at the property level for the past 10 years or so; it would be interesting to know if insurance payments are changing those rents, and how much they are passing on to renters. It could also be that if insurance causes property values to drop because it functions as a carrying cost then more of that at-risk housing stock will become lower-quality rental, and stop being maintained. I think this would be pretty interesting, but I'm a little unsure about the audience and how to go about it. 

I had an idea about Bayesian persuasion in insurance filings, but I'm not sure it really plays out in practice. I got all of the base rate increases from the WARFF system, and thought I'd noticed that lots of firms are just not filing for rate increases most years. However, that seemed to be more of a data processing error on my part rather than something fundamental. Still, kind of interesting, and maybe there's something there down the line. 

I'm also curious who gets stuck from climate migration. Is it worth writing a kind of lifecycle model that gets at climate migration? Or maybe a kind of simple OLG model with migration, building, etc.?
## Labor Markets
The labor market is "frozen" right now, and no one is hiring or firing. People seem quite confused by this, and the fed is lowering interest rates to make sure that this does not turn into something bad as the firing rate rises. However, I think what might be happening is that keeping an employee onboard has a real option value; you know how much they are worth, there's a costly process to reverse firing them. The same is true for hiring. We are in an extremely uncertain environment, for example with respect to tariffs, and it may be that firms are simply not hiring or firing because the "inaction" region for exercising those options has expanded, as it does in a classic investment under uncertainty sense. I think it might make sense to do textual analysis of large firms who file 10ks and have analyst calls, identify an "uncertainty" index for each of them, and then tie those to administrative data to look at hiring and firing for each of those industries. I could also look at the Gormsen discount rate data, which has embedded options in those, and see the extent to which those discount rates are driven by uncertainty. Then I could estimate a model of real options, get an estimate of the implied adjustment costs for labor. This probably has monetary policy implications as we attempt to address a weakening labor market.

## Behavioral / Language Models
This is an idea I've had for a while, and is kind of out of left field I realize. Jane Street makes all of its employees bet all of the time. It's just part of the culture. People bet on random subjective things many times a day, have side bets, etc., all with real money. I wonder if this helps people learn how to do Bayesian reasoning better, tying their subjective probability intuitions to the real world likelihood an event happens. I think it would be pretty interesting to have people (as part of a club, say) do this kind of training over the course of a year, and assess them with questions that elicit probability statements to see how accurate they are over time. 

Relatedly, I think this _is_ a way of training a large language model to be Bayesian. We know exactly how a Bayesian agent should gamble given beliefs and preferences; we can first align decisions with preferences via a supervised learning objective, and then we can tie those preferences to text-based descriptions of potential gambles, and train it to prefer the correct one. It would be interesting to know whether making an LLM gamble also translates to better probabilistic reasoning in other contexts.

Ok, I think those are all of my ideas for now.
## Summary

JMP agenda (probably)
* Broad agenda: how do financial markets incentivize us to adapt to climate change? 
* First, I want to look at insurance markets; are changing insurance prices changing the demand or cash-flow angle on:
	* Rents 
	* Commercial real estate 
	* Building 
* Second, I want to see if changing risks and prices are impacting the rent vs. buy decision for potential homeowners or renters?
* Third, I want to separate risk preferences from price shifts; are people obeying price signals or just worried about climate impacts?
* Fourth, I want to know how this changes the distribution of _who_ lives where. Are poor people going to relocate to the dangerous areas as prices shift? How should we think about those social impacts?

Some other things I'm thinking about:
* What are the adjustment frictions in labor markets? How does that shape firm decisions? If investments in firm-specific human capital are only partially reversible, maybe that explains why the labor market is "frozen" under high uncertainty
	* If you look at risk premia they are very low 
	* Giorado, Ludvigsson, Ng; Measuring Uncertainty 
		* https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19456/w19456.pdf
	* Maybe there's an AI shock
* It seems like many times firms simply do not ask to change prices in a given year--I wonder if this is true because of the choice of strategy they use to persuade the regulator
* Insurance has a known hiking cycle; I worry that the recent Mulder and Keys results are just coming from regressing two time series with AR processes on each other...
