I'm thinking about the daily note [[2025-09-21]] where I discuss some ideas around insurance papers.

I think there's two paths to go. The insurance idea is certainly more robust. Ideally, though, I need:
1. Insurer exposure by area (house). In California I have that for fire insurance, and I know which insurers are raising base premiums at the 7% threshold.
2. Connect this instrument with insurance data, see if it is leading to higher payments
3. Instrument for the payment level with the 7% threshold, see if this shows up
4. Look at mobility data in the census for SFH owners
5. Look at rents / rental share / renter mobility? 
6. Connect it with a lifecycle model for whether to rent / own / move, exogenous amenities
7. Estimate that lifecycle spatial model with census data 
8. Maybe the model needs home construction...? Can I find data on permits somewhere?

I think this is a nice case study. First, California has severe fire risks. Second, it has disclosures that let me see insurance at the provider level, which gives me a measure of exposure. 

I need to think through what the exclusion restriction is for the insurance prices. Insurance companies _would_ like to price fire insurance _higher_ than they are, but they are constrained by the politics and cost of a hearing. So we induce quasi-random underpricing cross-sectionally over insurers and in the time-series. I guess that works.

I guess the question here is how it relates to rents... Maybe I can use the Zillow rent indices? But all of those are going to need to be set in some kind of model. I think that exogenous amenities, partial equilibrium asset markets, but endogenous mobility would be a really neat thing to have, and we do have it in the census data.
