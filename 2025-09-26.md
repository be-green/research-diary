I think there's two paths to go. The insurance idea is certainly more robust. Ideally, though, I need:
1. Insurer exposure by area (house). In California I have that for fire insurance, and I know which insurers are raising base premiums at the 7% threshold.
2. Connect this instrument with insurance data, see if it is leading to higher payments
3. Instrument for the payment level with the 7% threshold, see if this shows up
4. Look at mobility data in the census for SFH owners
5. Look at rents / rental share / renter mobility? 
6. Connect it with a lifecycle model for whether to rent / own / move, exogenous amenities
7. Estimate that lifecycle spatial model with census data 
8. Maybe the model needs home construction...? Can I find data on permits somewhere?

I think this is a nice case study. First, California has severe fire risks. Second, it has disclosures that let me see insurance at the provider level, which gives me a measure of exposure. 

I need to think through what the exclusion restriction is for the insurance prices.
